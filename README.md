# David's Learning Journey

This is a project that documents my learning journey as a programmer. With the help of WOPR, I will be following a series of challenges and projects to improve my programming skills.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to document my progress as a programmer and learn new skills along the way. I will be following a series of challenges and projects, from the simplest to the most advanced, while learning new tools and technologies.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML5 to build the structure of the website, and Github to store and manage the source code. I am also using Git to control changes in the code and keep track of my progress.

## How to Contribute

This project is primarily for my personal learning, but if you have any suggestions or comments about the code or website structure, feel free to contact me or make a pull request. I appreciate any help or advice you can offer!
